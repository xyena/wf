			<h2>Quick Rundown</h2>
			<p>A passive that grants 5 HP/s to allies within 50m, scaling up to 25 HP/s after 200 health orb pickups, is not tremendously useful. A Wisp with 100% ability strength grants 30 HP/s with Vitality Mote. Citrine must focus on other ways to provide support beyond health regen in a world where Wisps and Dreamer's Bond have become so prevalent. However, this passive does mean Citrine can gain her first 200 health orbs per mission without needing to take health damage (after this point, some health damage will be required). Arcane Blessing (below) requires 50 health orbs to become maxed, so this is well within a safe range.</p>
			<p>Arcane Blessing is a must. Since Citrine's 1st ability is a LOS cone attack (with a surprisingly long distance-to-target at 235% range) that produces health orbs, this Arcane will pop off at a bonus 1200 health very quickly. If we assume 100% Strength, then 50 orbs spawning 50% of the time = 100 kills/assists until this Arcane is maxed. This saves a mod slot that would otherwise go to Vitality, Primed Vigor, etc. (This does NOT work with Equillibrium granting Health from Energy orbs.)</p>
			<p>Preserving Shell should be up at all times. This is your survivability. The ability's effect is controlled by Affinity Range, and does not scale at all to ability range. If not for the strong demand of her 1st and 3rd abilities, Narrow Minded would otherwise be a free insert here. Since the skill can be recast while active (and it will keep your current bonuses), Duration is not required but is a forgiving measure if you are not good at keeping an eye on your buff timers. The meager 40% damage reduction at default may seem as though this ability needs more Strength to be useful, but it doesn't. As long as you get kills and you are at least being tagged for assists (bonus is halved for assists), you'll be able to hit the 90% DR cap fairly consistently. Somewhere between 65&ndash;70% strength, assists round down to a +0% bonus. It is not recommended to go below 70% strength for this reason; however, this needs more testing, as this could simply be rounding below 0.5% and only be visual.</p>
			<p>Prismatic Gem is, arguably, her most important ability. Aside from slapping enemies in range with 1 of 4 random elemental status effects, this tags any enemy in range that takes weapon damage from an allied Tenno as an Assist for your Preserving Shell. Additionally, any enemy hit with Fractured Blast takes all 4 status effects 1 time per cast. The weapon damage version only goes off once every 0.4 seconds, which is less than ideal, but still good for </p>
			<p>Strength can be a dump stat for Crystallize, if that's all you're trying to make a build for. The only thing that Strength affects on her 4th ability is the Impact damage the initial cast creates, which is only 500 by default. Crystals shattering will always give a flat 300% critical chance regardless. In other words, Precision Intensify is useless on this frame (not including Helminth). Citrine's Recrystalize augment spreads Crystallize's effect within 16m, scaling with Range. This is just a better Resonance (Banshee Sonar) in almost every way: the duration of the ability refreshes when one enemy is killed in their weak point, whereas Resonance only triggers a new Sonar for 100% of the remaining duration. It does not have anywhere near Sonar's 35m base range, but one good Crystallize cast in an ideal situation could last the entirety of one Survival mission / Sanctuary Onslaught wave. If an explosion kills the enemy, then the crystal will count as "hit" and it will spread. However, a shattered crystal may not result in the target dying in high enough level content, and Recrystalize would not trigger under these circumstances. It also will not spread if the enemy dies under the effect of ability damage, such as Spore or Miasma.</p>
			<h2>Team Options</h2>
			<p>Citrine does not perform well in low-level missions. However, as with most support frames, if the mission is low-level enough that enemies are not being wiped every time they appear, then you're at the least not hindering anything. She generally does not pair well with allies doing mass ability damage, like Saryn, Equinox, Dante, etc., but the former two frames desperately need the survivability that Preserving Shell can grant. In higher level missions (125+), she can still support these frames. Damage Reduction sees less play nowadays than it used to, during Trinity's golden days circa 2017, as Adaptation's resistances granted by a single mod slot and 12 capacity is a lot less investment than one entire frame in the party out of four or less&mdash;but Adaptation does not protect against sudden burst damage like Blast, Toxin, and Tau damage that you really don't want to be on the receiving end of without that 90% already built up. Preserving Shell helps mitigate those terrifying first hits, for you and your party.</p>
			<h2>Other Options</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Molt Efficiency could see some use on a Primed Redirection Citrine, as 90% DR + fully fed Adaptation + mass staggering of enemies would greatly reduce the amount of shield damage taken and prevent the loss of your bonus +36% Duration. Duration is dubiously useful on Citrine, but a subsumed ability that takes advantage of more Duration could prove useful.</li>
				<li>A Strength value over 200% will guarantee spawning of Health Orbs with Fractured Blast. Going beyond this has a chance to produce an additional. One Blind Rage would nearly guarantee this effect; however, with Overextended, an additional 61% Strength would be needed to hit this threshold. Options would involve dropping Overextended and simply using Stretch and settling for a minimum of 145% Range, or simply devoting more mod space to Strength.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Final Conclusions</h2>
			<p>In order of importance:</p>
			<ul class="importance">
				<li>Range (Fractured Blast range (14m), Prismatic Gem radius (15m), Recrystalize spread range (16m))</li>
				<li>Duration (Preserving Shell duration (25s), Prismatic Gem duration (30s), Prismatic Gem bonus Status Duration (100%))</li>
				<li>Strength (Health Orb spawn chance (50%), Energy Orb spawn chance (20%), DR per kill (3%)/assist (1%), Prismatic Gem bonus Status Chance (100%))</li>
				<li>Efficiency (25, 50, 75, 100; Energy Orbs have increased drop chance from Fractured Blast)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It would take 400% Strength to guarantee 2 Health Orbs/kill, and 500% Strength to guarantee 1 Energy Orb/kill. Neither of these are feasible without serious mod investment or a Parasitic Link or Provoke/Peaceful Provocation.</p>
			<h2>Not recommended</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Molt Augmented requires Citrine to actually get the kill, not just assist. While this sounds nice for buffing her 1's orb drop chances, 250 enemies slain by Citrine's hand is a tall order for a support.</li>
				<li>The Ogris's Nightwatch Napalm does NOT trigger the Weapon Damage that causes Prismatic Gem to activate.</li>
				<li>Precision Intensify without a Subsumed 4th ability.</li>
				<li>Archon Intensify.</li>
			</ul>
